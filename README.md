# ðŸš— Sales Prediction
---
## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This machine learning project predicts a customerâ€™s car purchase amount using demographic and financial features such as age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

âœ… Features:
- Trained regression models
- Interactive **Streamlit web app**
- Clean and modular Python code
- EDA and model development in Jupyter Notebook
- Prediction CSV generation for business insights

---

## ðŸ“‚ [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction)

The dataset includes 500 rows and the following fields:

- `Customer Name`
- `Email`
- `Country`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Salary`
- `Credit Card Debt`
- `Net Worth`
- `Car Purchase Amount` (Target)

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Performed in the notebook and script:

- Handling missing/null values
- Outlier detection and removal
- Categorical encoding
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

- Linear Regression (default)
- Random Forest Regressor (optional extension)

Models are trained using `sklearn`, and evaluated on test data using:

- RÂ² Score
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

These metrics help assess model performance:

- **RÂ² Score**: Measures the proportion of variance explained
- **RMSE**: Indicates average prediction error
